1. ðŸŽ– Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. With these conditions
 * [ ] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of bank balance.
 * [ ] You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your spending threshold.
 * [ ] After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
 * [ ] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
 * [ ] Write a function called calculateTax which takes an argument 'amount' and calculates the tax you need to pay.
 * [ ] Write a function named formatAmount which returns you amount in this format '$ 132.45' make the decimal fixed to 2 places.
```js
const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;
// your code goes here

// Purchase phones until bank balance is exhausted
while(1) {
	if(bank_balance < 0) break;
	// console.log(bank_balance);
	bank_balance -= PHONE_PRICE;
	amount += PHONE_PRICE;
	if (amount < SPENDING_THRESHOLD) {
		bank_balance -= ACCESSORY_PRICE;
		amount += ACCESSORY_PRICE;
	}
}
// Can you afford it?
if (amount <= bank_balance) { 
  console.log('You can afford this');
} else { 
  console.log("You can't afford this");
}

// Calculate Tax
function calculateTax(amount) {
	return (TAX_RATE * amount);
}
// add tax into the amount and return the result
function formatAmount(amount) {
	return (amount + calculateTax(amount) );
}

console.log( `$ ${formatAmount(amount).toFixed(2)}` );

```
 â›‘ Answer of the above will `$334.76`.

2. ðŸŽ– Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen using `alert` (e.g. "2 is even").
```js
	for(var i = 0; i <= 20; ++i) {
		(!(i%2))&&alert(`${i} is even`);
	}
```

3. ðŸŽ–Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result in console (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

```js
	for(var i = 0; i <= 10; ++i) {
		console.log(`${i} * 9 = ${9*i}`);
	}
```

4. ðŸŽ–Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).
(e.g.
"1 * 1 = 1"
"1 * 2 = 2"
"1 * 3 = 3"
"1 * 4 = 4"
.... for all 100 results)
```js
	for(var i = 1; i <= 100; ++i) {
		for(var j = 1; j <= 100; ++j) {
			console.log(`"${i} * ${j} = ${i*j}"`);
		}
	}
```
5. ðŸŽ–Show the following output using one loop.
```js
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
	let a = '', b = '';
	for(var i = 1, j = 6; i <= 5; ++i, ++j) {
		a += i;
		b += j;

		if(i < 5) {
			a += ',';
			b += ',';
		}
	}
	console.log(a);
	console.log(b);
```

6. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to add up the numbers 1 to 20.
```js
	let res = 0, i = 21;
	while(i--) {
		res += i;
	}
	console.log(res);
```

7. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to print out the even number from 1 to 20. (You'll need Modulus for this. And an IF Statement.)
```js
// Your code goes here
	let i = 0;
	while(i++ < 21) {
		(!(i%2))&&console.log(`${i} is even`);
	}
```
